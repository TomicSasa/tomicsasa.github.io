    <h1>Privacy Policy for Time Kill: Athletics</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 2025-07-11</p>

    <p>Thank you for playing Time Kill: Athletics! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our game. We are committed to protecting your privacy. Because our game is intended for all legal ages specified by your local law, we have taken special care to safeguard the data of our users. If you are under the legal age specified by your local law, ask your parent to read this policy and provide guidance.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Time Kill: Athletics is designed to be simple and fun. We collect limited data to support integration with Apple's Game Center for leaderboard functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User ID</strong>: A unique identifier provided by Apple's Game Center to enable leaderboard rankings. This ID is not linked to any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We <strong>DO NOT COLLECT</strong> any other personally identifiable information, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names</li>
        <li>Email addresses</li>
        <li>Phone numbers</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Other sensitive personal information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The game does not require any special permissions to access your device’s features (e.g., camera, microphone, contacts, etc.).</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Apple's Game Center</h2>
    <p>Time Kill: Athletics integrates with Apple's Game Center to provide leaderboard functionality. The User ID collected from Game Center is used solely to display your ranking on the leaderboard. We do not use this data for any other purpose, and it is not shared with third parties except as required by Apple to operate Game Center. Apple's data practices are governed by their own <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Time Kill: Athletics is designed for users of legal ages specified by your local law and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from under-age children. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us immediately so that we can take prompt corrective action. For more details, please refer to your jurisdiction's applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>4. CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) Rights</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you have the right under the CCPA to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request disclosure of the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect.</li>
        <li>Request deletion of personal information.</li>
        <li>Opt out of the "sale" of personal information, if applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since we only collect a Game Center User ID and do not sell any personal information, these rights have limited applicability to Time Kill: Athletics. However, if you have questions about CCPA compliance, please contact us using the details in Section 7.</p>

    <h2>5. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) Compliance</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Union (EU), we adhere to GDPR principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lawful Basis</strong>: We process the Game Center User ID under the legal basis of "legitimate interest" to provide leaderboard functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Rights</strong>: You may request access, correction, or deletion of any data we collect (i.e., the Game Center User ID).</li>
        <li><strong>Data Transfers</strong>: The Game Center User ID is managed by Apple, and any data transfers are governed by Apple’s GDPR-compliant policies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise GDPR rights or ask questions, contact us via Section 7.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the limited information (Game Center User ID) collected through our app. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security, and you acknowledge and accept this risk when using our app.</p>
