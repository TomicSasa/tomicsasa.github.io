  <h1>Privacy Policy for Time Kill: Duel</h1>
  <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-02-20</p>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Thank you for playing Time Kill: Duel! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our game. We are committed to protecting your privacy while ensuring a personalized and high-quality advertising experience. Because our game is intended for ages specified by Age Rating, we have taken special care to safeguard the data of all users, including children.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Time Kill: Duel is designed to be simple and fun. We <strong>DO NOT COLLECT</strong> any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names</li>
      <li>Email addresses</li>
      <li>Phone numbers</li>
      <li>Location data (unless explicitly permitted for ad personalization purposes)</li>
      <li>Other sensitive personal information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The game does not require any special permissions to access your device’s features (e.g., camera, microphone, contacts, etc.).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Advertising and Tracking</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements within Time Kill: Duel. The app now implements Apple’s <strong>App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</strong> framework. This means that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You will be prompted to allow or deny tracking when you first launch the app. Any Ads shown before tracking selection are non-personalized by default.</li>
      <li>If you <strong>allow</strong> tracking, your device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) may be used to serve personalized ads.</li>
      <li>If you <strong>deny</strong> tracking, non-personalized ads will be served. In this mode, AdMob does not use your IDFA for ad personalization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, Google AdMob may collect the following non-personal data to optimize ad delivery:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (such as the Advertising ID when permitted or the Identifier for Vendor when tracking is not authorized)</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>Device information (e.g., device type, operating system version, app version, bundle identifier)</li>
      <li>Coarse location data (if the user has granted location permissions)</li>
      <li>Analytics and diagnostics data (to improve ad targeting, app performance, and stability)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google AdMob’s data practices are further described in their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not control the data collected by Google AdMob; however, we ensure that all ad practices comply with applicable laws and guidelines, including those for child-directed apps.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Time Kill: Duel is designed for users of all ages specified by Age Rating, including children, and complies with the <strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong>. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately so that we can take prompt corrective action.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) Rights</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you have the right under the CCPA to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request disclosure of the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect (though we do not collect personal information as outlined in Section 1).</li>
        <li>Request deletion of personal information (not applicable, as no personal data is collected).</li>
        <li>Opt out of the "sale" of personal information, if applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since we do not collect, use, or sell personal information, these rights do not apply to Time Kill: Duel. However, if you have questions about CCPA compliance, please contact us using the details in Section 9.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>5. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) Compliance</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Union (EU), we adhere to the GDPR principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lawful Basis:</strong> We process limited non-personal data (e.g., device identifiers via AdMob) for advertising purposes under the legal basis of "legitimate interest."</li>
        <li><strong>Your Rights:</strong> You may request access, correction, or deletion of any hypothetical personal data (though none is collected).</li>
        <li><strong>Data Transfers:</strong> AdMob may transfer data globally, but Google complies with GDPR and uses standard contractual clauses where required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise GDPR rights or ask questions, contact us via Section 9.</p>
</div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The only third-party service integrated into Time Kill: Duel is <strong>Google AdMob</strong> for advertising purposes. We do not share any user information with additional third parties. All data collection by AdMob is governed by Google’s policies and settings, including the opt-in or opt-out choices you make via the ATT prompt.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect any information that may be collected through our app. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security, and you acknowledge and accept this risk when using our app.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make significant changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page and, when appropriate, notify you via the app or other means. We encourage you to review this policy regularly to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
